# Sigla App: AI-Powered Barangay Information System

The Sigla App is a proof-of-concept barangay information and service system featuring an AI-powered conversational agent built with Google's Vertex AI. This application was developed by our team of three during a 1-day coding session for the GENAIUS HACKATHON 2025, aligning with the theme "AI for the Underserved: Tech AI in Justice". Sigla aims to provide underserved communities with intuitive, natural language access to vital local services and essential program information.
